## IDEA 
- Roomate tracking app using facebook (or Twitter or Insta or Tiktok depending on API availability) data to identify connections 
- Self tagging preferences - female roommate desired etc, and users can define tags. Unlimited tags and then we could match 
based on % of identical tags 
- Graph theory based on the social media data to extrapolate people with network connections 

## TOOLS 
- React frontend 
- Material UI for CSS 
- Sketch for images, or designers 
- Slack for keeping track of what we are working on 
- GCP for hosting 
- Axios 
- Hooks/Functional 
- Tentatively Mongo/Atlas for db
