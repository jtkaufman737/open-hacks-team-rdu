# coronAlert front end single page app

This application was borne out of the idea that it is challenging for those of us with loved ones spread around the globe to keep track 
of coronavirus cases. We wanted something to allow us to get the numbers on cases, recoveries, and fatalities in one place.

The application has the ability for a user to create customizable alerts, so that in addition to a US wide map they can track
the specific statistics in states where their loved ones live.

On top of the interactive dashboard created with Plotly, users have the ability to receive phone and email notifications daily 
keeping them aprised of the case numbers wherever they are.

# To run the app locally 
- Select git clone 
- `cd open-hacks-team-rdu-fe` 
- `brew install yarn` (for Mac) 
- `yarn install` 
- `yarn start` 
- Navigate to localhost:3000 *however you will also need to follow the readme for https://github.com/jtkaufman737/open-hacks-team-rdu-be
for the API calls to work! We are sorry it isn't deployed we had some last minute challenges, but if there are any setup issues that prevent 
the judging from moving forward please contact myself or Rick Thomas and we are happy to demo if there are any environmental 
or setup issues that would stop you from seeing the app in action

# Future improvements 

To keep the app relevant, we intend to: 
- Add vaccination information when one becomes available
- Add other countries! The APIs exist, we just didn't have time to build logic for them all in this hackathon
